                    The event not only informed the students of ADA university, and raised their interest regarding the topic of learning. They responded positively to the explanation of the process and logistics behind basic code and enjoyed doing the exercises. 

To be well prepared for the event we came in early before the lesson. However even with our informing the school about the websites that we are supposed to use we encountered a small problem which we solved quickly, and proceeded to instruct an interesting lesson for the students. Every kid had their own device so we instructed them where which website they should go to, to participate. We also called up each student to do one exercise at the teacher's desk so that the other students could see each exercise play out on the monitor. We also provided assistance to anyone who couldnâ€™t solve some exercises.

Our efficient time management allowed us to get everything done in an hour. We covered all the necessary points and when we were leaving the kids wanted us to come again some day to conduct another lesson.

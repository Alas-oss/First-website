                <p>Rather than just showing the presentation and doing the exercises, we first taught them the base principles of Hour of Code exercises. Aliya Alasgarova, Elmar Misirzada, Nigar Yusifova, and Urfan Zeynalov took on the task of planning an introductory course at Landau School. We tried to include about 15 year-six students in the coding experience despite an ongoing event that we were not told about.</p>

            <div id="Aliya" class="memberbio"><h3>Aliya Alasgarova</h3><p>
                My major is Computer Engineering. For as long as I remember myself I have been interested in technology and the science behind it. Some of my interests are also astrophysics, language learning, sports and technological innovation. I always loved studying exact sciences and computer engineering has to be one of the most precise ones out there, for this reason I find it very interesting and understandable. I want to participate in the exploration of space and the universe in which we live, and since technology is becoming a major part of all sciences, I could play a part in future investigations.

            <div id="Elmar" class="memberbio"><h3>Elmar Misirzada</h3><p>
                My specialty is IT. There are a few things I'm interested in. For example, playing games, spending time with friends, playing football, listening to songs and so on. As everyone knows, my favorite football player is Leo Messi, my song is Forever in My Mind, and my game is Pes 2021. My future expectation from my current major is to work with more than enough financial means in an environment where I feel valued. Finally, I would like to add that I particularly like Professor Araz's teaching method.

            <div id="Nigar" class="memberbio"><h3>Nigar Yusifova</h3><p>
                My major is IT and I am interested in art and music. My favorite painter is Pablo Picasso, I love his extraordinary paintings. With his artwork, I try to inspire myself to draw more. I love spending time with instruments and learning about their hidden sides. I get goosebumps when I hear a masterpiece on a piano and try to compete with my friends about who will catch the rhythm quickly with guitar. I'm also planning to open a dance club in the university and make choreography moves to different songs from various cultures. My expectation from my major is to work productive while i make time for my hobbies and my loved ones instead of working in a field which makes me suffer from 9 to 5 without achieving any goals and living a stable life.

                My major is Electric-Electronic engineering. I love playing basketball and proudly secured first place in a Baku schools tournament. Stephen Curry is my go-to player for inspiration on the court as he effortlessly scores three-pointers.
